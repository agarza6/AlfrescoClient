# Should the scheduled sync job use differential or full queries on the user
# registries to determine the set of local users to be updated? When true,
# each user registry is only queried for those users and groups modified since
# the most recent modification date of all the objects last queried from that
# same source. When <code>false</code> then <i>all</i> users and groups are
# queried from the user registry and updated locally. Nevertheless, a separate
# query will be run by the scheduled sync job to determine deletions.
